Assignment 1 for CSC 361

The program accepts URI using the sys library. It gets the command line input by 
accessing sys.argv[1].

The program parses the URL using the urllib.parse library. It splits the "domain" name from
the "path" text. This is so I can implement the path in the HTTP commands. 

In order to see if the webpage supports HTTP/2, it first sends an OPTION request to the server. 
If it is unable to see if it supports HTTP/2, it will check TLS/ALPN to see if HTTPS uses HTTP/2.

It lists cookies by splitting the Set-Cookie line on the response message. It then splits
each line separated by ';' and detects when domain and expires exist in the string. 
It appends it to a string print_cookies which will be printed out by the end of the for-loop.

For checking to see if the webpage is password-protected, the program connects to host implicitly,
using the IP address and adding the "Connection: close" to the request sent to the server.

Then once all data is processed and saved into variables, it splits the relevant text from 
the response line and outputs the information.
