Assignment 1 for CSC 361

The program accepts URI using the sys library. It gets the command line input by 
accessing sys.argv[1].

In order to see if the webpage supports HTTP/2, it first sends an OPTION request to the server. 
If it is unable to see if it supports HTTP/2, it will check TLS/ALPN to see if HTTPS uses HTTP/2.

It lists cookies by splitting the Set-Cookie line on the response message. It then splits
each line separated by ';' and detects when domain and expires exist in the string. 
It appends it to a string print_cookies which will be printed out by the end of the for-loop.

// leftover code that is saved for later
s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) #Creates a socket object
s.connect((URI, 80))
s.send("GET /index.html HTTP/1.0\n\n")
data = s.recv(10000)
s.close()

print("data incoming... \n%s" % data)
